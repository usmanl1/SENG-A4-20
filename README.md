# Introduction

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

In the process of creating our Selenium test suite, we began by thoroughly exploring the website to get a good understanding of its diverse functionalities and features which can be used for testing. We documented these functions, actions like system login, add product to card, search local nearest store, product searches for both existing and non-existing items, among others. Subsequently, we systematically executed each function with varied test inputs if it was possible for the specific test. Once we had a deep familiarity of the website's operations, we methodically made the test scenarios into Selenium scripts one by one. Our efforts culminated in the creation of 14 distinct test cases aimed at scrutinizing the system major functionality. These cases ranged from comprehensive tests like valid and invalid username logins to standalone assessments such as validating gift card codes.
